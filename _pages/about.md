Hi, my name is Shijie Lu. I’m a 1st year Ph.D. student in computer science at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Xusheng Xiao](https://xusheng-xiao.github.io/). I am broadly interested in real-world computer security topics. More specifically, I focus on studying web security/privacy problems and building secure systems that can be used in practice.

Before ASU, I received my bachelor’s from Wuhan University of Technology, and received M.S. from George Washington University.

Research Projects
======
1. Detect malicious behaviors in system audit logs with application logs. System audit logs contain rich information of the state and transition of a computer system. These logs are typically collected through recording low level system call events and are thus noisy and huge.
